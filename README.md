**Key Findings:**
*   **Total Revenue:** $9.16 million.
*   **Pricing Strategy:** A robust positive correlation exists between product price points and applied discount percentages, indicating a well-defined pricing model.

These findings provide actionable intelligence to optimize inventory management, refine marketing strategies, and enhance overall pricing models, ultimately driving improved sales performance.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis:
- Top-performing products should be kept in stock .
- Marketing should be directed towards products from "And India," "Casio," "Aurelia," and "Adidas" as they tend to generate higher sales.
- Pricing and discount adjuststments; higher discount items recieved higher sales regardless of discount so discount percentage should be reduced in order to maximize profit.

## Assumptions and Caveats
